# Python for Devs

Welcome to the **Python for Devs** repository! This project is dedicated to my journey of learning Python using the book *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes.

## About the Project

This repository contains code examples, exercises, and projects that I complete while working through the book. My goal is to develop a solid foundation in Python programming, and I aim to share my progress and learnings here.

## Installation

To get started with the materials in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Mainagithubrit/python_work.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd python_work

		# You can choose between python_work and pythonWorkphone
		# python_work was done through my computer
		# pythonWorkPhone was done using termux
		# Each folder contains different works from the same book
		# Some of the work on python_work doesn't have the shebang run using Vscode

3. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.

4. Optionally, create a virtual environment:

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate

Usage
Explore the different chapters and projects as you learn Python. Each folder corresponds to a chapter or topic from the book, containing code snippets and exercises.

Feel free to run the scripts and modify them to see how changes affect the output. This hands-on approach will help reinforce your learning!
